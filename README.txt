Name: Das Milkshake

Description: This is a simple rot13 challenge. Running the
ciphertext through ROT 13 should make the key obvious. The pariticipants simply
need to do a search for teh word 'flag'. The story is a creative-commons
attribution story from ficlet.com. If participants google for the title, "Das
Milkshake" it will show the story as the second hit, which should be a big clue
for the plaintext.

To Build: No building necessary. To rebuild do:
    python rot13.py -f plaintext.txt > cipher.txt

What to Distribute: ciphertext.txt

Flag: MCA-76696765 (points to vigenere)
